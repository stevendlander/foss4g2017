                        ## Containerizing your geospatial applications with Docker
                        #### FOSS4G Boston 2017

                        Note:
                        Hello everyone and thanks for attending my presentation
                        on geospatial containers and how they can help you
                        develop, deploy, and manage applications more easily.
                        In this talk I hope to make clear why containers are
                        popular in software development but also underscore the
                        ways in which Docker and programs like it can reduce
                        rework and cut mundane tasks from your workflows.
                        Let's begin.

                        Once again my name is Steve Lander, and I have been in the
                        geospatial domain for going on 7 years now in various
                        roles, most recently as a project technical lead and
                        architect.  Applied research is a good way of
                        describing the sorts of projects I have been working on
                        recently, for example, API development for tile
                        caching and storage.

                        ### Outline

                        * Why even use containers? How will they benefit me?
                        * Ok...what are some ways I can make one?  How do I get
                        started?
                        * What are some more advanced topics?

                        Note:
                        What will we be discussing today: How are containers
                        fundamentally different from other technologies and why
                        is that a good thing?  What are some easy ways to get
                        started making containers that help me do my job?  And
                        finally, for those of you well-versed in Docker and
                        similar programs already, what are some advanced topics
                        to take you further.

                        * Build environment containers typically run as _root_
                        which a linux host will honor
                        * Passing credentials as environment variables is
                        convenient but insecure, and solutions are complicated
                        to implement
